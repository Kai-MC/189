# Machine-Learning

This repo is consists of several self-implemented ML model, including neural network, and random forest, and a Final Paper on image-to-image translation.


## [The Final Paper](https://github.com/Kai-MC/Machine-Learning/blob/main/CS289A_Project_Report%20(1).pdf)
This study explores image-to-image translation using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks (CycleGAN) and proposes improvements to its architecture. We trained and compared three models: a basic CycleGAN, a model employing U-Net and ResNet, and an improved CycleGAN model incorporating a gradient penalty and a modified Adam optimizer. Our results indicate that the improved model outperforms the others in terms of loss and visualization, demonstrating the effectiveness of our modifications for colorization tasks.
